# Introduction
I wanted to challenge myself with learning something new.

I chose shaders for some reason. 

my learning is based on:

* chat with Google's gemini's career guide
* OpenGl tutorials and how-to guides:
  * [learn opengl](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started)
  * [Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming by Jason L. McKesson](https://nicolbolas.github.io/oldtut/index.html)

## Additional notes


I'll make comments and notes in the code to clarify what it does and why.
this is not production code, so there will be clutter.

* [my journey with opengl](./learn_opengl/MySummeryAndUnderstanding.md)


## TODO
- [ ] read the second source
- [ ] clean code in the gemini sources
- [ ] add links in the readme to the code
- [ ] read and understand what are hte differece bwetween the libraries [GLFW, GLUT, SDL, SFML](learn_opengl/01_creating_window/creating_window.md/#but-first)
